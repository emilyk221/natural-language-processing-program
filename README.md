  ## Description
  This application allows the user to process a text file to learn some information about it. This example processes the 2020 presidential debate between Trump and Biden, first splitting the text into two separate speakers before analysis. Then the app returns a list of the top 30 most often used words by each presidential candidate, a bar chart displaying these words and their frequencies, and some readability scores to determine the "reading level" of each participant's words of the debate.
